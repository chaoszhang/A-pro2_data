In S100, method `apro` means ASTRAL-Pro and `aster-new` means ASTRAL-Pro2.

In stat_exp (S25 dataset), `method2` means ASTRAL-Pro and `aster-new` means ASTRAL-Pro2.

`apro-pep.ml.renamed.tre` and `apro2-pep.ml.renamed.tre` are estimated species trees taking as input `pep.ml.renamed.trees` (derived from [Butler et al., 2009](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08064)).

`apro-c12-quartets.tre` and `apro2-c12.tre` are estimated species trees taking as input `1kp-c12-genetrees.tre` (derived from [Wickett et al., 2014](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1323926111)).
